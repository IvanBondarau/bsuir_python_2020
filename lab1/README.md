### Main tasks

1. __Word count__  
Calculate and display statistics on how many times each word is repeated in the received text.  
_Input:_ text  
_Additional requirements:_ use dict() or its analogues 
2. __Most duplicated words__  
Based on the last paragraph: make and print a sentence from the 10 most often duplicate words in the resulting text.  
_Input:_ text  
_Additional requirements:_ use built-in string operators
3. __Quick sort__

4. __Merge sort__  
Implement merge sort algorithm  
_Input:_ Array of numbers as a string. The numbers in the string are separated by spaces.  
_Additional requirements:_ use slices


__Additional tasks__

1. Write a generator that returns successively Fibonacci numbers starting from the first

2. Read the input data for each of the tasks described above from a file with a fixed name.

3. When working with a file, use the _with_ context operator.

4. Use command line arguments to get the name of the file from which to read the input.
        Use command line arguments to get the name of the file from which to read the input.

5. Combine all the tasks described above into one program and determine which subroutine to run using command line arguments.
Use the _argparse_ module.
